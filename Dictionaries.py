"""
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value,
and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.
A keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary.
a dictionary is wrapped in braces, {}, with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces.
